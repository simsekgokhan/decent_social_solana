# decent_social (Decentralized Social Media DApp)

This repository demonstrates how to build/deploy/use/test an initial version of a decentralized social media program (smart contract) and its front end code on the Solana blockchain.

Summary:  
- Solana tools installed from scratch on Ubuntu 20.04, devnet configured, account created (all are documented in [section 2. Setup](README.md#2-setup) below)
- [decent_social](program) Solana program (smart contract)   
- [front_end](front_end) demo app. (client, utility and main.rs functions)
- [Integration tests](front_end/src/integration_tests)
- [Unit tests](https://github.com/gsimsekfb/decent_social/blob/main/program/src/instruction.rs#L13)
- [CI (Continuous Integration) tests](.github/workflows) (using [github actions](https://github.com/gsimsekfb/decent_social/actions))
- `cargo clippy` used

This repo consists of two independent projects, for convinience they are placed together.   
`program` directory has Solana program (smart contract).  
`front_end` directory has the client side app.  

## 1. How to use
Hint: For first time users, see [section 2. Setup](README.md#2-setup) below.

#### Build & Deploy Solana program (smart contract)

```
cd program
cargo build-bpf
solana program deploy target/deploy/decent_social.so 
```

#### Use deployed Solana program with front_end demo app
```
cd front_end
cargo r user10
    >> Connected to remote solana node running version (1.16.15).
    
    >> Create account for program to read/write its data...
    ... creating program derived account
    --- result : ()

        followers: 100,
        blocked_account: false,
    }
    
    End
```

#### Unit tests
```
~/decent_social/program$ cargo t
    running 2 tests
    test instruction::user_profile_unit_tests::create_new_profile_with_default_values ... ok
    test instruction::user_profile_unit_tests::init_new_profile_ ... ok
    test result: ok. 2 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s
```

#### Integration tests
```
~/decent_social/front_end$ cargo t
    running 1 test   
    test integration_tests::user_profile_tests::test_new_user_profile_with_dummy_values ... ok
    test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 1.39s
```
